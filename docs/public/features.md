# ✨ Core Features

## 🎬 Multiple Creation Modes

| Mode | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Simple Video** | Single prompt → single AI video. Full control over all parameters (generation mode, duration, resolution, seed, negative prompt). Also supports image-to-video and keyframes mode. | Quick single-clip AI video |
| **Creative Video** | Full AI pipeline: idea → story → script → character reference → multi-scene video → narration → subtitles → final output. 10-step pipeline, fully automated. | Storytelling, creative videos |
| **Manuscript Video** | Paste a long article or script → auto-split by reading duration → per-segment AI video → unified TTS narration + subtitle overlay → final output. 5-step pipeline. | Explainers, course content, vlogs |
| **Digital Anchor** | AI-generated digital anchor (or upload custom image) → dynamic anchor clip → TTS narration → subtitle positioning → looped concatenation. Optional reference image for appearance consistency. | Virtual anchors, product presentations, news broadcasts |
| **Music Video** | Upload a song (up to 5 minutes) → one AI clip per 10 seconds → the original song as the only audio track → automatic lyric recognition with burned-in lyric subtitles. Optionally keep one consistent singer/performer across every clip, from your own photo or AI-generated from a description. Lyrics are optional; if recognition fails, the video is still produced without subtitles. | Music videos, lyric videos, song promos |

## 🎵 Music Videos

Upload a song and get a music video built around it:

- **Supported formats**: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC, OPUS; up to 50 MB and 5 minutes (at least 10 seconds).
- **One AI clip per 10 seconds**: the song is split into 10-second segments (the last one is the remainder), and each segment gets its own scene prompt that follows the lyrics in that part of the song. A style preset or your own style text applies to every clip.
- **The original song is the soundtrack**: the final video uses your song as its only audio track — no text-to-speech, no volume boost.
- **Automatic lyrics**: lyrics are transcribed locally with faster-whisper (CPU, `small` model by default; set `AGNES_LYRICS_MODEL` to use another size). Recognized lines can be burned into the video as subtitles. If recognition fails, or the song has no vocals, the task still completes without subtitles.
- **A consistent singer or performer**: pick **none** (no reference image), upload a **photo** of the performer, or describe them and let the **AI image model** generate the portrait (up to 500 characters). Whichever you choose, that single image is submitted as the reference image of every segment, so the same person appears in all clips instead of drifting between them.
- **Readable storyboard**: every task writes a `storyboard.json` that lines up the exact time spans, the recognized lyric lines for each span and the generated scene visuals. Download it from the task's artifact list to review or hand-tune your music video.
- **Mind the queue**: clips are submitted through the video API rate limit (one submission per minute per API key by default), so a 5-minute song (about 30 clips) takes at least 30 minutes to submit before rendering finishes.

## 🆓 Completely Free AI Model Chain

All core AI capabilities are **completely free** — no trial period, no watermarks, no token limits:

| Capability | Model | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Text / Script Generation | `agnes-3.0-flash` | Free |
| Image Generation | `agnes-image-2.5-flash` | Free |
| Video Generation | `agnes-video-v2.0` | Free |
| Text-to-Speech Narration | Edge TTS (Microsoft) | Free, no extra API key needed |

All AI API calls share a token-bucket rate limiter (shared bucket defaults to 20 × number of keys × 0.8 requests/min, plus a separate bucket for video submissions), with automatic retries and exponential backoff to ensure stable operation.

## 🎙️ AI Narration & Smart Subtitles

Both Creative Video and Manuscript Video support:

- **Free TTS narration**: Based on Microsoft Edge TTS, with a dynamic voice catalog grouped by the 22 UI languages (voice preview + cross-language compatibility checks) and adjustable speech rate
- **Word-level fine-grained subtitles**: SRT subtitles generated from TTS word-level timestamps, one entry every 2-3 seconds, with precise audio-video sync
- **Multi-line auto-wrapping**: Long subtitle text is intelligently split into two lines, preferring punctuation break points to prevent screen overflow
- **Fully configurable subtitle style**: Font, color, size, position (top/bottom), stroke, and semi-transparent background
- **Audio-video sync strategy**: All video clips are concatenated first, then audio and subtitles are overlaid as a whole, avoiding cumulative errors from per-segment overlay. TTS output is automatically amplified 1.5× to compensate for Edge TTS's low default volume

## 🎨 Flexible Creative Controls

- **Custom reference images** — Upload character or scene reference images to maintain visual consistency across scenes
- **Custom end frames** — Specify end frame images per scene for precise visual transition control
- **Image-to-image end frames** — Auto-generate scene end frames via img2img from your reference image
- **Three video chaining modes** — `keyframes` (first+last frame interpolation, recommended) / `ti2vid` (inter-scene transition frames) / `none` (independent scenes)
- **Multiple resolutions** — Portrait 9:16 (768×1152), Landscape 16:9 (1280×720), Square 1:1 (1024×1024)
- **Flexible duration** — Custom scene duration
- **Smart manuscript splitting** — Splits by period/question mark/exclamation mark, greedily merges into 5-12 second segments based on reading speed (~4 chars/sec), preserves long sentences, auto-merges short sentences forward

## 🔧 Production-Grade Reliability

- **Checkpoint resume** — Automatically resumes from the last checkpoint after interruption; state is persisted after each step, no duplicate API calls
- **Task management** — Create, view, resume, and stop tasks from the Web UI
- **Live progress** — Frontend polls task state (`GET /api/tasks/{id}`) for per-step generation progress (step name, status, percentage, current/total); no WebSocket needed
- **Built-in CJK fonts** — Project ships with Chinese fonts, no garbled characters in subtitle rendering

## 🤖 AI Agent Friendly

Designed specifically for AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, QoderWork, etc.), with a complete `AGENTS.md` deployment guide. AI Agents can automatically:

- Check environment (Python 3.10+, ffmpeg)
- Install dependencies and start the server
- Configure API key
- Run 4-layer deployment verification (connectivity → static analysis → endpoint testing → subtitle feature)
- Execute 14-scenario regression test suite

## 🌐 Multilingual Web UI

One-click launch, operate entirely in the browser. Interface available in **22 languages**: 中文, English, Deutsch, Français, Nederlands, Español, Português, Italiano, Русский, 日本語, 한국어, Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Indonesia, العربية, Türkçe, Tiếng Việt, ไทย, Tagalog, हिन्दी, فارسی, বাংলা, اردو. The voice catalog and subtitle font fallback cover the same 22 languages (including Arabic / Persian / Urdu RTL ligature shaping and Thai / Devanagari / Bengali font fallback).

## 🎬 Three AI Video Chaining Modes

| Mode | How It Works | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **keyframes** | Specify first + last frame per scene; server auto-interpolates transitions | Smooth transitions (recommended) |
| **ti2vid** | Last frame of previous scene → img2img transition → first frame of next scene | Visual continuity between scenes |
| **none** | All scenes share the same reference image, independent of each other | Fast output, independent scenes |
